# Shipyard

A light-weight, powerful, HTML/CSS framework for faster web development.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save @cloudbees/shipyard
```

## Usage

The root of the published npm package can be found at [`_assets/shipyard`](https://github.com/cloudbees/shipyard/tree/master/_assets/shipyard)

We distribute both the raw `sass/*.sass` source files along with the `icons/*.svg` source files.  These can be utilized within your projects via direct import.

We also produce a pre-built css file and a pre-built svg icon sprite file that can be used at `dist/shipyard.css` and `dist/icons.svg`.

You can see further documentation of how to actually use the styles by taking a look at [the styleguide](https://cloudbees.github.io/shipyard).
